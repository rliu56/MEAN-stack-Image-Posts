It is a RESTful single page application for users to manage their own images or share them to others. Deployed on AWS.  

  It consists of:  
  * a RESTful stateless server, which can be connected to multiple different types of clients (browser, mobile app, etc.) without being modified, to satisfy different kinds of usersâ€™ needs.  
  * a Single Page Application with Angular as the front-end, which can be dynamically re-rendered without being reloaded, and provides a responsive and fast mobile-app-like user experience.  
  * Web Framework Components: Routing, ODM and Middleware.  
  * Authentication, authorization, file uploading and error handling.  

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
